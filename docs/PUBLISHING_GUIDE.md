## Publishing Pathway

### Step 1: Preprint on SSRN (Immediate)

**What**: Social Science Research Network — a preprint server  
**URL**: https://www.ssrn.com/  
**Cost**: Free  
**Time**: 1-2 days for approval

**Why SSRN first:**
- Establishes priority (timestamp proves you had the idea first)
- Gets feedback before peer review
- Builds citation history
- Many economists read SSRN daily

**How to submit:**
1. Create account at ssrn.com
2. Go to "Submit a Paper"
3. Upload PDF of your paper
4. Add abstract, keywords, JEL codes
5. Select "Labor Economics" category

### Step 2: Working Paper Series

Consider submitting to:
- **IZA Discussion Papers** (Institute of Labor Economics)
- **NBER Working Papers** (if you have a connection)
- **Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI)**

### Step 3: Peer-Reviewed Journal

Target journals by tier:

**Tier 1 (Ambitious)**
- Journal of Labor Economics
- Review of Economic Studies
- Quarterly Journal of Economics

**Tier 2 (Realistic)**
- Labour Economics
- Journal of Human Resources
- Economic Journal

**Tier 3 (Entry Point)**
- Applied Economics
- Economics Letters
- Scandinavian Journal of Economics

## Paper Structure

### Suggested Title

> "Semantic Skill Matching and Labor Market Frictions: Evidence from Swedish Public Employment Data"

### Abstract Template

```
This paper presents a novel approach to labor market matching using 
semantic skill extraction from Sweden's national employment taxonomy. 
Traditional matching systems rely on keyword matching of job titles, 
which creates information asymmetries and search frictions 
(Diamond, Mortensen, Pissarides 2010). We demonstrate that by 
decomposing human capital (Becker 1964) into measurable "skill atoms" 
and traversing hierarchical relationships in the taxonomy graph, 
matching precision increases by [X]% compared to title-based methods. 
Using Arbetsförmedlingen's open data APIs, we identify latent career 
pathways invisible to conventional systems. Our methodology addresses 
the signaling problem (Spence 1973) by providing cleaner signals of 
worker productivity than job titles alone.

## Theoretical Framework (Use These Citations)

### 1. Search and Matching Theory (DMP Model)

**Citation**: Diamond, P., Mortensen, D., & Pissarides, C. (2010). Nobel Prize Lecture.

**How to use it**:
> "Our system directly addresses the search frictions identified by Diamond, Mortensen, and Pissarides (2010). By reducing information asymmetry between job seekers and employers, semantic matching lowers the cost of search and improves matching efficiency."

### 2. Human Capital Theory

**Citation**: Becker, G. (1964). Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis. University of Chicago Press.

**How to use it**:
> "Following Becker (1964), we distinguish between general and specific human capital. Our methodology reveals general human capital hidden behind specific job titles, enabling workers to identify transferable skills."

### 3. Signaling Theory

**Citation**: Spence, M. (1973). Job Market Signaling. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87(3), 355-374.

**How to use it**:
> "Job titles function as noisy signals of worker productivity (Spence 1973). Our skill atom approach provides a higher-fidelity signal by decomposing titles into measurable competencies."

### 4. Synthetic Control Methods (For Evaluation)

**Citation**: Abadie, A., Diamond, A., & Hainmueller, J. (2010). Synthetic Control Methods for Comparative Case Studies. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 105(490), 493-505.

**How to use it**:
> "To evaluate causal impact, we employ synthetic control methods (Abadie et al. 2010) to construct counterfactual outcomes for job seekers who did not use semantic matching."
